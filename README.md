# C-Sockets

This repo is for me to learn about sockets, forks, file descriptors, etc.

The idea is to have a reverse shell client/server/proxy on a single file.

# Usage:
```
Usage: main [command]
Command:
    help
    listen  <port>
    connect <address> <port> 
    proxy   <listen_port> <target_address> <target_port>```
